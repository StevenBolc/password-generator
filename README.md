initially, i couldnt figure out how to display the message on screen. after some research i found that i wasn't concatenating properly.
After looking through previous class modules, i went with a concat method, as it seems cleaner than other methods ive seen ( still not sure if i can combine the upper, lower case letters)
added better logic to the questions and math.floor arguments.
